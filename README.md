Sim MapReduce
=============

Experience the hair-raising, white-knuckle, thrills, spills* and excitement of [Apache Hadoop MapReduce](http://hadoop.apache.org/)  without the inconvenience of setting up a cluster of your own. (\* no pun intended)

```
Usage: ./simmapreduce.sh [level] (default="beginner")
```

* Test your **patience** and **boredom threshold** to the limit with the configurable BIG DATA level. Choose between "beginner", "intermediate" and "expert" for an increasingly realistic MapReduce experience. 

* Witness first-hand the terrifying effects of **reducer skew**, where those final couple of percent just take _so_ much longer. 

* Impress your friends and family with **huge numbers** on job completion. Are those gigabytes? Terabytes? Surely not petabytes!? Who really knows without handy separators between digits. 

* COMING SOON: **failed task simulator**. Because nothing says f-you like a 99% completion going back to 98. 

Enjoy!
